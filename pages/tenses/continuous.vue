            <p>
                Called continuous tenses because the sentence structures contain an action that occurs, or
                continues over a period of time - usually an ACTIVITY.
            </p>
            <p>
                I prefer to call them ‘in the middle of doing something’ tenses, because the subject of the
                sentence is always in the middle of doing something at a point of time either in the present (right
                now), the past, or the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have broken each tense down into four basic sentence types:
            </p>
            <p>
                Positive - sentences containing actions that are occurring, were occurring or will be occurring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negative - sentences containing actions that are not occurring, were not occurring or will not be
                occurring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Closed questions - sentences containing questions resulting with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. These
                questions always start with the auxiliary verbs am/is/are, was/were or will + (subject) + be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open questions - sentences containing questions resulting with an answer in the form of a
                sentence. These questions always start with what, why, where, when, who, which, whose or
                how.

                Non-continuous verbs - verbs that we do not normally use with continuous tenses. These are
                known as "stative" verbs are about state, not action. Examples below:
            </p>
            <p>
                Hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish, appear, feel, hear, see, seem, smell, sound, taste, agree,
                deny,
                disagree, mean, promise, satisfy, surprise, believe, imagine, know, mean, realise, recognise,
                remember, understand, be, belong, concern, depend, involve, matter, need, owe, own, possess
            </p>
