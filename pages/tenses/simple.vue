                    Called simple tenses because the sentence structures contain one or two verbs only. They are
                    also some of the easiest and most common tenses to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have broken each tense down into four basic sentence types:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Positive - sentences containing actions that occur, occurred or will occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Negative - sentences containing actions that do not occur, did not occur or will not occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Closed questions - sentences containing questions resulting with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. These
                    questions always start with the auxiliary verbs do/does, did or will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open questions - sentences containing questions resulting with an answer in the form of a
                    sentence. These questions always start with what, why, where, when, who, which, whose or
                    how. (We also call them WH questions for obvious reasons).
